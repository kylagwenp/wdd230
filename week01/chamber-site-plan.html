        <h2>Site Plan</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p>Baguio Chamber of Commerce. The name "Baguio Chamber of Commerce" was selected to clearly represent the
                city
                of Baguio, emphasizing its local identity. Including the word "Chamber" in the site name is a common
                convention for chambers of commerce websites, signifying its role as a business-oriented organization.
                The
                choice of "Baguio" in the name ensures a strong connection to the city where the chamber operates,
                fostering
                a sense of community and local engagement.</p>
